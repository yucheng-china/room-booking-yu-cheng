<h2>Room Booking System</h2>
<p>testing user account: Username:user1  password:user1   ID:abc123</p>
<p>testing admin account: Username:admin   password:admin</p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This is my mini room booking system, first welcome to here! You will see the whole system after enter it and make further actions. Login as a user
and you could use the room booking, view your booking details etc. Login as an administrator then you could use the room add, room delete,
view customer details etc. The design requirements are listed in the next chapters. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Sample login details</h3>
<p>You could login as a user or as an administrator.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>Login as user you need (Username+Password+ID), ID is the primary key.</b></dt>
<dd>user1: (user1+user1+abc123)---------user2: (user2+user2+abc456)</dd>
<br>
<dt><b>Login as administrator you need (Username+Password), only one administrator.</b></dt>
<dd>admin: (admin+admin)</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<h3>SQL Database Used</h3>
<p>There are four tables in my application, they are <b>registration</b>, <b>customer</b>, <b>admin_login</b> and <b>room</b>.</p>
<p><b>Registration</b> table was used to store the user information (not administrator) which include <i><b>USERNAME</b></i>, <i><b>PASSWORD</b></i>, <i><b>ID (primary key)</b></i>, <i><b>EMAIL</b></i>. All of them are String type.</p>
<p> <b>SQL:</b> create table registration (username varchar2(20), password varchar2(20), id varchar2(15) primary key, email varchar2(20))</p>

<br>
<p><b>Admin_login</b> table was store the administrator information which include <i><b>USERNAME</b></i>, <i><b>PASSWORD</b></i>. All of them are String type.</p>
<p> <b>SQL:</b> create table admin_login (username varchar2(20), password varchar2(20))</p>
<img src="room_img/admin_login.jpg" alt="Pulpit rock">

<p><b>room</b> table was store the room information which include <i><b>ROOM_NO</b></i>, <i><b>ROOM_CATEGORY</b></i>, <i><b>CAPACITY</b></i>, <i><b>BOOKED_BY</b></i>, <i><b>STATUS</b></i>. All of them are String type except room_no.</p>

<h3>functionality</h3>
<p>The functionality could divided as user functions and administrator functions.</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>user functions.</b></dt>
<br>
<dd>Login in and login out.</dd>
<dd>Make rooms booking.</dd>
<dd>View their booking details after book.</dd>
<dd>Query by email.</dd>
<br>
<dt><b>administrator functions.</b></dt>
<br>
<dd>Login in and login out.</dd>
<dd>Insert rooms (room_no should be integer, otherwise will cause view problem in delete)</dd>
<dd>View room details.</dd>
<dd>Update room details after inserted (room_no can't be change).</dd>
<dd>Make room delete after inserted.</dd>
<dd>View customer details (user who booked rooms already called customer).</dd>
</dl>
<br>
<h3>Some possible problem</h3>
<p>The browse i used in my application was google chrome. I tested it in other browses and the view problem happend eg. The logout, home button show in different position. But all
the functions will not be impacted. Therefore, you best run it on goole chrome to have the best view, but it still work in other browses without best view.</p>

<br>
<p>As i mentioned in last chapter, you may meet the view problem if you add a room with string or other type of room_no. Because the room_no was created with the integer type. Actually, it should not impact too much, but just avoid it please.</p>
<br>
<h3>Additional works</h3>
<p>Actually there are not too much additionally works, some form-validations i have added in my application were very simple. I don't satisfied too much about it</p>
<p><b>Login-validation:</b> you should provide Username+Passowrd+ID, each of them are required, you can't miss anyone, and these contents must match the database contents respectively.</p>
<p><b>Room-Booking-validation:</b> room_no and ID cannot be changed, the check_in and check_out date should be standard form and cannot make booking before 10 April. But i should modify it a little bit so that the check_out date must be the same day as check_in date or several days after the check_in date.</p>
<p><b>registration-validation:</b> you should provide all information as these information are required.</p>
